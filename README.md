Sankalp Sahu's Portfolio website - https://sankalp774.github.io/My-Portfolio/
This repository contains a single-file, production-ready portfolio website for Sankalp Sahu, a 4th-year Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student specializing in AI and app development. The site features a cyberpunk/Matrix theme with animated code-rain background, neon accents, and responsive design. It's built as a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript—no build tools or dependencies required.
