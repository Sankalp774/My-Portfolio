# My-Portfolio
Sankalp Sahu's Portfolio
This repository contains a single-file, production-ready portfolio website for Sankalp Sahu, a 4th-year Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student specializing in AI and app development. The site features a cyberpunk/Matrix theme with animated code-rain background, neon accents, and responsive design. It's built as a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript—no build tools or dependencies required.
Features

Theme: Matrix-inspired code rain (using canvas for performance), neon green/cyan accents, dark mode by default.

Splash Screen: A welcoming modal with typewriter effect that fades away after 3 seconds (dismissible via click or Esc).

Sections: Hero, About Me (with photo), Projects, Skills, Experience, Education, Blog, Contact.

Interactivity: Smooth scrolling, modals for project/blog details, contact form (client-side validation, mailto integration), reduced motion toggle for accessibility.


Responsive: Mobile-friendly with hamburger menu on small screens.

Customization: Easy to edit via constants in JS (e.g., name, projects array, colors).

Accessibility: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, alt texts, prefers-reduced-motion support.

Performance: Lazy-loaded images, no heavy assets.
